# Trade Project Improvement Plan

This document outlines the strategic plan for improving the Trade Project. It organizes the tasks from `tasks.md` into logical phases to ensure a structured approach to development.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements

### Goals
- Establish proper project structure and configuration
- Improve code quality and documentation
- Implement basic testing framework

### Tasks
1. Create a configuration management system using a config.py file
2. Implement proper type hints throughout the codebase
3. Add docstrings to all classes and methods
4. Create a comprehensive README.md
5. Create unit tests for core components

## Phase 2: API and Data Management

### Goals
- Enhance API functionality and reliability
- Improve data handling and storage
- Implement better error handling

### Tasks
1. Create a unified API interface for all exchanges
2. Implement rate limiting and retry mechanisms for API calls
3. Create a proper database schema for storing historical data
4. Implement a data validation layer
5. Standardize error handling across the codebase

## Phase 3: Performance and Advanced Features

### Goals
- Optimize performance for data processing and execution
- Implement advanced trading features
- Enhance security measures

### Tasks
1. Optimize data loading and processing
2. Implement caching for frequently used calculations
3. Implement backtesting functionality
4. Implement risk management tools
5. Implement secure storage for API keys

## Phase 4: Deployment and Scaling

### Goals
- Prepare the project for production deployment
- Implement monitoring and maintenance tools
- Enhance user experience

### Tasks
1. Create Docker containers for the application
2. Implement CI/CD pipelines
3. Create a web dashboard for monitoring
4. Implement different log levels for different environments
5. Add support for alerts and notifications

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Iterative Approach**: Complete tasks in order of priority within each phase
2. **Testing First**: Implement tests before or alongside new features
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation as code changes are made
4. **Code Reviews**: Ensure all changes meet the style guidelines in `.junie/guidelines.md`
5. **Milestone Reviews**: At the end of each phase, review progress and adjust the plan as needed
