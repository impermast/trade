# Trade Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the Trade Project. Each item starts with a placeholder [ ] to be checked off when completed.

## Architecture and Design

### Project Structure
[x] Create a proper project structure with setup.py for package installation
[x] Implement a configuration management system using a config.py file
[x] Reorganize the project to follow a more modular structure
[x] Create a unified entry point for running different components
[x] Implement a proper dependency injection system

### API Layer
[x] Create a unified API interface for all exchanges
[x] Implement rate limiting and retry mechanisms for API calls
[x] Add support for additional exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase)
[x] Create a mock API for testing purposes
[ ] Implement websocket support for real-time data

### Data Management
[x] Create a proper database schema for storing historical data
[ ] Implement a data versioning system
[x] Create a data validation layer
[x] Implement efficient data caching mechanisms
[x] Create a data pipeline for preprocessing

## Code Quality

### General
[x] Fix missing imports in XGBstrategy.py (os, sys)
[x] Implement proper type hints throughout the codebase (XGBstrategy.py, BirzaAPI, Analytic, data_parse.py, rsi.py completed)
[x] Add docstrings to all classes and methods (XGBstrategy.py, BirzaAPI, Analytic, data_parse.py, rsi.py completed)
[x] Standardize error handling across the codebase
[ ] Remove commented-out code and TODOs

### Refactoring
[x] Refactor the Analytic class to reduce complexity
[x] Extract the nested Indicators class into a separate module
[ ] Refactor the BirzaAPI class to include more common functionality
[x] Improve parameter handling in BaseStrategy
[ ] Refactor the fetch_data function to be more modular

## Testing

### Unit Tests
[ ] Create unit tests for all API clients
[ ] Implement tests for all trading strategies
[ ] Create tests for the Analytic class
[ ] Implement tests for the Logger class
[ ] Create tests for utility functions

### Integration Tests
[ ] Implement integration tests for the entire trading pipeline
[ ] Create tests for data fetching and processing
[ ] Implement tests for strategy execution
[ ] Create tests for the logging system
[ ] Implement end-to-end tests for the entire system

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
[ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all classes and methods
[ ] Create a style guide for the project
